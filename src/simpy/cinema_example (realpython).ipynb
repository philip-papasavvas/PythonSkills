    "# Example - Cinema Simulation\n",
    "Simulating Real-World Processes in Python with SimPy\n",
    "Work through another example of using SimPy from [realpython.com](https://realpython.com/simpy-simulating-with-python/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define the problem\n",
    "The first step of running a simulation is to choose to process a model. \n",
    "In this example, we will imagine we are consulting for a small cinema chain, who have bad reviews due to long waiting times. The company has done some research, and found out that the average customer is willing to wait for at most **10 minutes** between arriving at the venue, and wanting to be sat down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the problem has been formulated as helping to **get wait times below 10 minutes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brainstorm the algorithm\n",
    "Before approaching the problem from a coding perspective, first work out how the process will work in real life. This will ensure that the code is an accurate reflection of what happens in real life. First, list the possible steps someone who visits the cinema would face.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps on entering a cinema:\n",
    "1. **Arrive** at venue\n",
    "2. **Queue** to buy ticket\n",
    "3. **Buy** ticket\n",
    "4. **Queue** to get ticket checked \n",
    "5. **Get** ticket checked\n",
    "6. Decided whether to get drinks/food:\n",
    "    - If yes, **purchase drinks/food**\n",
    "    - If no, go to the last step\n",
    "7. **Go** directly to the seat\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have defined the steps above, we can see which parts of the process can be controlled by the cinema chain itself. An example would be how long a customer waits before buying their ticket or drinks/food, and this can be controlled by the number of staff serving these customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are parts of the process that cannot be controlled, such as when the customers are arriving at the venue, or in what volume they will arrive. Since we cannot accurately guess this number, this parameter will have to be filled with available data to determine an appropriate arrival time.\n"
